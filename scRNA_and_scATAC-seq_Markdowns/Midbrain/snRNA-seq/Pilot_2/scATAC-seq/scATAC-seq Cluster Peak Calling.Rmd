Exploring how to get qvalues from the .narrowpeak file. The MACS2 documentation states that the 9th column is the -log10qvalue at peak summit (e.g. pvalue = 1e-10, then this value should be 10). (although in other places the value in the table is described as -log10qvalue * 10 - however, I have checked my version of MACS2 and the version listed in the documentation and they are the same, indicating that this is the current layout and perhaps the -log10qvalue * 10 calculation comes from an earlier version of MACS2)

```{R}

-log10(1e-10)

10^(-(10))

head(Astrocyte_Peaks$minus_log10_qvalue)

10^(-(13.76852))

10^(-(13.76852/10))

-log10(0.04199021)*10

```


```{R}
Astrocyte_Peaks$qvalue <- 10^(-(Astrocyte_Peaks$minus_log10_qvalue))

Astrocyte_Peaks <- Astrocyte_Peaks[Astrocyte_Peaks$qvalue < 0.05,]
```
